Task 1 - Award

Objective:
+ Learn how to us if...else  (Conditional Statement)

Task Details:
+ Create a new Python file in this folder called award.py.
+ Design a program that determines the award a person competing in a
triathlon will receive.
+ Your program should read in user input for the times (in minutes) for all
three events of a triathlon, namely swimming, cycling, and running, and
then calculate and display the total time taken to complete the triathlon.
+ The award a participant receives is based on the total time taken to
complete the triathlon. The qualifying time for awards is 100 minutes.
Display the award that the participant will receive based on the following

Task 2 - Manipulation 

Objective : 
+ Learn how to operate the string value , e.g. replace value , extract characher from a word / sentenances.  (Data Type)

Task Details:
+ Create a new Python file for this task and call it manipulation.py. 
+ Ask the user to enter a sentence using the input() function. Save the user’s
response in a variable called str_manip. 
+ Explore the string methods in here to help you solve the problem below:
+ Using this string value, write the code to do the following:
+ + Calculate and display the length of str_manip.
+ + Find the last letter in str_manip sentence. Replace every occurrence 
of this letter in str_manip with ‘@’. 
+ e.g. if str_manip = “This is a bunch of words”, the output would
be: “Thi@ i@ a bunch of word@”
+ + Print the last three characters in str_manip backwards.
+ e.g. if str_manip = “This is a bunch of words”, the output would
be: “sdr”. 
+ + Create a five-letter word that is made up of the first three characters
and the last two characters in str_manip. 
+ e.g. if str_manip = “This is a bunch of words”, the output would
be: “Thids”.

Task 3 - Numbers 

Objective:
+ Learn how to operate the number ( Sum , Minus, divide , etc)

Task Details:
+  Create a new Python file called numbers.py.
+  Ask the user to enter three different integers.
+  Then print out:
+ + The sum of all the numbers
+ + The first number minus the second number
+ + The third number multiplied by the first number
+ + The sum of all three numbers divided by the third number
