"""

As in the previous practical task, please first provide pseudocode as
comments in your Python file, outlining how you will solve this problem.
● Declare the following variables:
○ num1 = 99.23
○ num2 = 23
○ num3 = 150
○ string1 = “100”
● Convert them as follows:
○ num1 into an integer
○ num2 into a float
○ num3 into a string
○ string1 into an integer
● Print out all the variables on separate lines.
Be sure to place files for submission inside your task folder and click "Request
review" on your dashboard.

#Step 1:


num1 = 99.23
num2 = 23
num3 = 150
string1 = "100"




#Step 2: Convert variables
num1_int = int(num1)
num2_float = float(num2)
num3_str = str(num3)
string1_int = int(string1)


#Step 3:  Print the variables
print(num1_int)
print(num2_float)
print(num3_str)
print(string1_int)
