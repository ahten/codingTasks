Task 1 - Hello World

Objective
+ Understanding the how to take user input, then process the input value and print on screen 

Task Details
+ (1) Create a new Python file in your folder for this task, and call it
hello_world.py.
+ (2) First, provide pseudocode as comments in your Python file, outlining
how you will solve this problem (you’ll need to read the rest of this
practical task first, of course).
+ (3) Now, inside your hello_world.py file, write Python code to take in a user’s
name using input() and then print out (output) the name.
+ (4) Use the same input and output approach to take in a user’s age and
print it out.
+ (5) Finally, print the string “Hello World!” on a new line. Note: The new line
will happen by default if you use a separate print statement to the one
you used immediately above to print out the age. This is because each
print statement automatically inserts an “enter”, or newline instruction,
at the end.

Task 2 - Value Conversion 

Objective
+ Understanding how to convert the number to different value type ( integer , float , string) 

As in the previous practical task, please first provide pseudocode as
comments in your Python file, outlining how you will solve this problem.
+ Declare the following variables:
+ + num1 = 99.23
+ + num2 = 23
+ + num3 = 150
+ + string1 = “100”
+ Convert them as follows:
+ + num1 into an integer
+ + num2 into a float
+ + num3 into a string
+ + string1 into an integer
+ Print out all the variables on separate lines.
