"""
This script processes input either from standard input (stdin) or from a
specified file. Reads lines from stdin or a file and prints them to standard
output (stdout).

Usage:
    - If no arguments are provided, reads from stdin.
    - If a filename is provided as a command-line argument, reads from that
      file.

Modules:
    sys: Provides access to command-line arguments and standard input/output
    streams.

    This function reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints each line
    to standard output (stdout). This simulates the behavior of the 'cat' command.
