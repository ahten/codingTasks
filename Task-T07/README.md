Task 2 - Cafe

Objective: 
+ Learn how to handle Array. Store, extract, update value from a array. 

Task Details: 
+ ● Imagine you are running a café. Create a new Python file in your folder
called cafe.py.
+ ● Create a list called menu, which should contain at least four items sold in
the café.
+ ● Next, create a dictionary called stock, which should contain the stock
value for each item on your menu.
+ ● Create another dictionary called price, which should contain the prices for
each item on your menu.
+ ● Next, calculate the worth of the total_stock in the café. You will need to
remember to loop through the appropriate dictionaries and lists to do
this.
+ + Tip: When you loop through the menu list, the “items” can be set as keys
to access the corresponding “stock” and “price” values. Each item_value is
calculated by multiplying the stock value by the price value. For example:
item_value = (stock[item] * price[item])
+ ● Finally, print out the result of your calculation
